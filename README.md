# Name_detection_from_Resume_docx_format
This code's main purpose is to extract and identify person names from a Word document and print the first name found, if any. It utilizes NLTK for natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
This Python code is designed to extract and identify person names from a Microsoft Word (.docx) document. It uses the docx2txt library to extract text content from the document and the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library for natural language processing tasks.
Import necessary libraries:

docx2txt: This library is used for extracting text from Word documents.
nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit is used for text processing and analysis.
Download NLTK resources:

The code downloads essential NLTK resources, including tokenizers, part-of-speech taggers, named entity recognizers, and word lists.
Define a function to extract text from a Word document:

The extract_text_from_docx function takes the path to a Word document as input, processes it using docx2txt, and returns the extracted text as a string. It also replaces tabs with spaces.
Define a function to extract person names from text:

The extract_names function takes the extracted text as input and uses NLTK for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER).
It tokenizes the text into sentences and then tokenizes each sentence into words.
It performs part-of-speech tagging to identify the grammatical roles of words in each sentence.
It applies named entity recognition to identify entities like persons, organizations, and locations.
Specifically, it looks for entities labeled as 'PERSON,' indicating a person's name, and extracts these names.
Check if the script is being run as the main program:

The code uses if __name__ == '__main__': to ensure that the following code is executed only when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).
Extract text from a Word document:

It calls the extract_text_from_docx function to extract text from a Word document named 'Arnab.docx' and stores the extracted text in the text variable.
Extract person names from the extracted text:

It calls the extract_names function with the extracted text as input and stores the list of person names in the names variable.
Print the first person name if any were found:

Finally, it checks if any person names were found (the names list is not empty), and if so, it prints the first person name in the list.
